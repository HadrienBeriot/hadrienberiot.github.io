I am a hands-on Innovator and Senior Research Manager, specialized in computational physics, with 18 years of experience in technology incubation for the Computer Aided Engineering industry. 

I lead a research team at Siemens Digital Industries Software, based in Leuven, Belgium and in Ch√¢tillon, Paris. 
We focus on the development of advanced numerical methods for computational acoustics, aero-acoustics and structural dynamics. 
Our research directly contributes to enhancing the Siemens Simcenter product portfolio, within the broader Xcelerator digital transformation programme.
We explore and research different technologies by fast prototyping features or concepts, and refine the selected solutions into algorithms that are robust and user friendly. 
We are part of a vast network of academia/research institutions and participate in many regional, national and EU research projects.
