I am a hands-on research manager with 18 years of experience in technology incubation for the Computer Aided Engineering industry. 

I lead the Acoustics and Finite Elements Research Team, based in Leuven, Belgium and in Ch√¢tillon, France.  

I am also visiting researcher at the University of Liege, in the team of [Christophe Geuzaine](https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/geuzaine/).
